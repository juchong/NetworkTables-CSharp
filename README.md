# NetworkTables-CSharp
A bare-bones implementation of NT4 for C#. Designed for unity but does not rely on it. Modeled after the NT4 Code from [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/MechanicalAdvantage/AdvantageScope).

This is by no means a complete implimentation of the protocol and several methods are straight up ignored as of now. This package may or may not be updated in the future and may or may not be supported.
